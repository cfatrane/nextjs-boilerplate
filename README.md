## Getting Started 🤔

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

### Commitlint

commitlint checks if your commit messages meet the [conventional commit format](https://conventionalcommits.org).

In general the pattern mostly looks like this:

```sh
type(scope?): subject  #scope is optional; multiple scopes are supported (current delimiter options: "/", "\" and ",")
```

Real world examples can look like this:

```text
chore: run tests on travis ci
```

```text
fix(server): send cors headers
```

```text
feat(blog): add comment section
```

Common types according to [commitlint-config-conventional (based on the Angular convention)](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/tree/master/@commitlint/config-conventional#type-enum) can be:

- build: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)
- chore: Other changes that don't modify src or test files
- ci: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Travis, Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs)
- docs: Documentation only changes
- feat: A new feature
- fix: A bug fix
- perf: A code change that improves performance
- refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- revert: Reverts a previous commit
- style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests

#### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
- When only changing documentation, include `[ci skip]` in the commit title
- Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji:
  - 🎨 `:art:` when improving the format/structure of the code
  - 🐎 `:racehorse:` when improving performance
  - 🚱 `:non-potable_water:` when plugging memory leaks
  - 📝 `:memo:` when writing docs
  - 🐧 `:penguin:` when fixing something on Linux
  - 🍎 `:apple:` when fixing something on macOS
  - 🏁 `:checkered_flag:` when fixing something on Windows
  - 🐛 `:bug:` when fixing a bug
  - 🔥 `:fire:` when removing code or files
  - 💚 `:green_heart:` when fixing the CI build
  - ✅ `:white_check_mark:` when adding tests
  - 🔒 `:lock:` when dealing with security
  - ⬆️ `:arrow_up:` when upgrading dependencies
  - ⬇️ `:arrow_down:` when downgrading dependencies
  - 👕 `:shirt:` when removing linter warnings

### Prisma

```sh
# Set up a new Prisma project
$ prisma init
# Generate artifacts (e.g. Prisma Client)
$ prisma generate
# Browse your data
$ prisma studio
# Create migrations from your Prisma schema, apply them to the database, generate artifacts (e.g. Prisma Client)
$ prisma migrate dev
# Pull the schema from an existing database, updating the Prisma schema
$ prisma db pull
# Push the Prisma schema state to the database
$ prisma db push
# Validate your Prisma schema
$ prisma validate
# Format your Prisma schema
$ prisma format
# Display Prisma version info
$ prisma version
# Display Prisma debug info
$ prisma debug
```

#### Getting started with Prisma Migrate

##### Customizing migrations

In some scenarios, you need to edit a migration file before you apply it. For example, to change the direction of a 1-1 relation (moving the foreign key from one side to another) without data loss, you need to move data as part of the migration - this SQL is not part of the default migration, and must be written by hand.

This guide explains how to edit migration files and gives some examples of use cases where you may want to do this.

###### How to edit a migration file

To edit a migration file before applying it, the general procedure is the following:

1. Make a schema change that requires custom SQL (for example, to preserve existing data)

2. Create a draft migration using:

   `npx prisma migrate dev --create-only`

3. Modify the generated SQL file.

4. Apply the modified SQL by running:

   `npx prisma migrate dev`

###### [Example: Rename a field](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-migrate/workflows/customizing-migrations#example-rename-a-field)

###### [Example: Change the direction of a 1-1 relation](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-migrate/workflows/customizing-migrations#example-change-the-direction-of-a-1-1-relation)

### Storybook

WIP

### Test

Generate a basic Jest configuration file by running the following command `npm init jest@latest`

This will take you through a series of prompts to setup Jest for your project, including automatically creating a `jest.config.ts`.

Jest will look for test files with any of the following popular naming conventions:

- Files with `.js` suffix in `__tests__` folders.
- Files with `.test.js` suffix.
- Files with `.spec.js` suffix.

The `.test.js` / `.spec.js` files (or the `__tests__`folders) can be located at any depth under the `src` top level folder.

We recommend to put the test files (or `__tests__` folders) next to the code they are testing so that relative imports appear shorter. For example, if `App.test.js` and `App.js` are in the same folder, the test only needs to `import App from './App'` instead of a long relative path. Collocation also helps find tests more quickly in larger projects.

To run test `yarn test`

## VSCode Extensions 💻

### [Better Comments](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=aaron-bond.better-comments)

The Better Comments extension will help you create more human-friendly comments in your code.
With this extension, you will be able to categorize your annotations into:

- Alerts
- Queries
- TODOs
- Highlights
- Commented out code can also be styled to make it clear the code shouldn't be there
- Any other comment styles you'd like can be specified in the settings

### [Tailwind CSS IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss)

Tailwind CSS IntelliSense enhances the Tailwind development experience by providing Visual Studio Code users with advanced features such as autocomplete, syntax highlighting, and linting.

### [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)

Integrates ESLint into VS Code. If you are new to ESLint check the documentation.

The extension uses the ESLint library installed in the opened workspace folder. If the folder doesn't provide one the extension looks for a global install version. If you haven't installed ESLint either locally or globally do so by running npm install eslint in the workspace folder for a local install or `npm install -g eslint` for a global install.

On new folders you might also need to create an .eslintrc configuration file. You can do this by either using the VS Code command Create ESLint configuration or by running the eslint command in a terminal with `npx eslint --init`.

### [i18n Ally](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SonarSource.sonarlint-vscode)

General Features

- Supports multi-root workspaces
- Supports remote development
- Supports numerous popular frameworks
- Supports linked locale messages
- Uses i18n for the extension itself, of course. Translation List

### [SonarLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Lokalise.i18n-ally)

SonarLint by Sonar is a free IDE extension that empowers you to fix coding issues before they exist. More than a linter, SonarLint detects and highlights issues that can lead to bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells as you create your code. It offers clear remediation guidance and educational help, so you can fix issues before the code is committed. SonarLint in VS Code supports analysis of JS/TS, Python, PHP, Java, C, C++, C#, Go, and IaC code locally in your IDE.

### [Error Lens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=usernamehw.errorlens)

ErrorLens turbo-charges language diagnostic features by making diagnostics stand out more prominently, highlighting the entire line wherever a diagnostic is generated by the language and also prints the message inline.

## Deployment 🚀

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
