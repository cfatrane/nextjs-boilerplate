## Getting Started 🤔

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Vscode Extensions

### [Better Comments](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=aaron-bond.better-comments)

The Better Comments extension will help you create more human-friendly comments in your code.
With this extension, you will be able to categorise your annotations into:

- Alerts
- Queries
- TODOs
- Highlights
- Commented out code can also be styled to make it clear the code shouldn't be there
- Any other comment styles you'd like can be specified in the settings

### [Tailwind CSS IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss)

Tailwind CSS IntelliSense enhances the Tailwind development experience by providing Visual Studio Code users with advanced features such as autocomplete, syntax highlighting, and linting.

### [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)

Integrates ESLint into VS Code. If you are new to ESLint check the documentation.

The extension uses the ESLint library installed in the opened workspace folder. If the folder doesn't provide one the extension looks for a global install version. If you haven't installed ESLint either locally or globally do so by running npm install eslint in the workspace folder for a local install or `npm install -g eslint` for a global install.

On new folders you might also need to create an .eslintrc configuration file. You can do this by either using the VS Code command Create ESLint configuration or by running the eslint command in a terminal with `npx eslint --init`.

### [i18n Ally](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Lokalise.i18n-ally)

General Features

- Supports multi-root workspaces
- Supports remote development
- Supports numerous popular frameworks
- Supports linked locale messages
- Uses i18n for the extension itself, of course. Translation List

### [Error Lens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=usernamehw.errorlens)
